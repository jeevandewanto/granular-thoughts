On 21-24 February 2025 I went to Atami, Shizuoka for my first international conference. The event was the first Geomechanics Alliance in Asia (GAIA) workshop. Technically, it was not a "conference", there was no publication involved in the event and the event was targeted as a platform for young researchers in the geomechanics field to present, discuss their research and socialize with others within the field. And the event was exactly like that, the overall 'vibe' was more family gathering-like than an international conference, which was exactly what I needed.
