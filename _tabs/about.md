Halo! I'm Jeevan. An Indonesian guy doing PhD in Tokyo.

I started this website to be something like my "publicly accessible notebook" where I can collect my thoughts and ideas and have them visible to people. I feel like the best way for me to solidify new ideas is to write them down, and having them visible to people forces me to articulate them clearly. Hopefully, things here will be much neater and organized compared to my "private notebook", which pretty much unreadable (even I struggle reading them). However, this site is still just a "notebook", not a proper CV or portfolio website, so things will be definitely "organic" (messy, but readable).

Additionally, as a non-native speaker (writer, reader and also listener) of English, I want this site to be my exercise notebook for English writing. For this reason, I have committed myself to limit the use of AI tools during writing (definitely no text generation). Once my Japanese improve, I might start mixing in Japanese posts too—though I’m still sooooo far from that point.

Sampai jumpa!
